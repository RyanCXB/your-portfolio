# 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan Chen  
### Senior Manager, Business Intelligence → Analytics Engineer / Data Engineer (Hybrid)

I design scalable data systems that combine  
**Business Intelligence × Data Engineering × ML-driven forecasting**  
to support enterprise-level decision-making.

Currently at Verizon, I lead BI/AI strategy, automate ETL pipelines, build metric layers, and develop analytics platforms used across finance and consumer organizations.

## 🔹 About Me

I specialize in building analytics systems that bridge **business logic** and **data engineering**.

At Verizon, I:
- Led the Business Intelligence function and defined the BI/AI roadmap  
- Automated ETL pipelines using Python and SQL  
- Built data modeling standards and governed metric layers (ARPU, churn, subsidy margin)  
- Developed predictive forecasting pipelines using machine learning models  
- Delivered executive dashboards supporting real-time operations and financial reporting  

Previously, I owned the end-to-end customer subsidy analytics pipeline, engineered SQL models used for forecasting and budgeting, and built analytic data marts supporting senior leadership decision-making.

My background uniquely blends **data engineering**, **BI strategy**, and **financial analytics**, enabling me to build systems that drive business impact.
