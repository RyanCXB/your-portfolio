# 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan Chen  
### **Senior Manager, Business Intelligence → Analytics Engineer / Data Engineer**

I design scalable data systems that combine  
**Business Intelligence × Data Engineering × ML forecasting**  
to support enterprise-level decision-making.

I specialize in leveraging BI strategy, data modeling, ETL automation, and ML forecasting to build analytics platforms used across finance and consumer organizations.

---

## 🔹 About Me

I focus on building analytics systems that bridge **business logic** and **data engineering**.

At Verizon, I:
- Led the Business Intelligence function and shaped the BI/AI roadmap  
- Automated ETL pipelines using Python and SQL  
- Built data modeling standards and governed metric layers (ARPU, churn, subsidy margin)  
- Developed predictive forecasting pipelines using ML models  
- Delivered executive dashboards for financial and operational reporting  

Previously, I owned the end-to-end **customer subsidy analytics pipeline**, engineered SQL models for forecasting, and built analytic data marts used by senior leadership.

My background uniquely blends **data engineering**, **BI strategy**, and **financial analytics**, allowing me to create systems that are both technically sound and business impactful.
