# Enterprise BI & AI Analytics Platform  
**End-to-End BI Architecture | Python ETL | Metric Layer | ML Forecasting**

---

## Overview
This project documents the enterprise BI/AI analytics platform I built and led at Verizon.  
It demonstrates how I designed and automated data workflows, standardized metric modeling, and integrated predictive analytics into executive reporting systems.
